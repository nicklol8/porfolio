      <h4>
        Hi! I'm Nick, a software engineer based in Fairfield County, CT. Here to
        write some clean, efficient, and DRY code!
      </h4>
      <p class="about-me">
        My first interactions with software engineering started in high school,
        where I was picked to attend an information technology magnet school in
        Stamford. While it gave me skills in everything Microsoft, it also gave
        me the opportunity to try my hand at everything from visual basic
        programming, GIS, animation, photography, and most importantly it opened
        to door to web design, starting with Adobe Dreamweaver.<br />
        Holding onto that basic foundation I found myself walking down the path
        of psychology in college and graduated with a Bachelors degree. After
        college I immediately started to work with special needs children, and
        although I was rewarded with patience and problem solving skills, I
        found myself looking back at all the previous skills I had once known
        and started the “What if...” game. Here is the start of that game: my
        projects and portfolio, I hope you enjoy as much as I enjoyed making
        them

                  The Pokéstop: my first app! Using the pokéapi, I was able to
                  create a version of the Pokédex to fetch info about whatever
                  pokemon the user chooses! Including fetching and displaying
                  sprites, type, and extra flavor text. After completing the
                  pokédex, I moved on to recreate the "Who's that Pokémon" game
                  featured in the original show! This was a very fun project,
                  and seeing my favorite childhood memories come to life I
                  realized the endless possibilities of things to create!

                  My personal recipe book! A solution for a problem I had:
                  somewhere to store all my recipes that is easy to access at
                  home and the store! Users can browse recipes, or sign up and
                  add some of their own . A full-stack Express/EJS app with a
                  Mongo database.

                  My first experience with group coding, and a fun project to
                  work on! We decided to make an app where we could add
                  restaurants(including a few favorite items from the menu) in
                  our area to the database. When logged in, users have access to
                  a favorites list, where they can add restaurants they like for
                  easy access.

                  My first game! Given the freedom to create anything, and I
                  decided to make an infinite running game! A very fun
                  challenge, and really tested my ability to read docs and
                  problem solve on my own, using Phaser, a Javascript framework
                  no one around had any experience with. Includes a rails
                  backend using sql to keep track of the leaderboard!
